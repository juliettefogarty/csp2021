    <h2>Draw by Typing.</h2>
    <img src="butterfly.jpg" height="400" width="450">
    <p style="background-color:White;font-family:'Courier New'"><font size=4>In this project, my group and I decided to make a customizable, interactive drawing program that allowed the user to choose different things to draw and the colors with which to fill it in. The options were a butterfly, apple, snowman, or car, and each option allowed the user to choose three colors. The color options were red, pink, purple, green, blue, black, and gray. Once the user inputted their drawing and color choice and pressed enter, the program would create their personal drawing and add a moving sun in the background.</font></p>

    <h2>WordSmith.</h2>
    <img src="wordgame.jpg" height="400" width="450">
    <p style="background-color:White;font-family:'Courier New'"><font size=4>This game allows the player to type the words that appear on the screen in the clouds, which causes them to drop and create a score at the top of the page. The words change randomly from the table we created, and there is no time limit for typing the words out. Once the three words on the screen fall, three new ones appear, and the game continues.</font></p>

    <h2>Monster Story.</h2>
    <img src="monsterstory.jpg" height="400" width="450">
    <p style="background-color:White;font-family:'Courier New'"><font size=4>The Monster Story project is a roleplay type game where the player plays the character of a monster that wishes to become friends with humans. The player can go through the game and at different scenarios they are given options for which path they can take, which affects the ending of the game. Different responses provoke different endings that can range from you (the monster) becoming friends with the human village or ending up alone in the wild.</font></p>

    <h2>Maze Quest.</h2>
    <img src="mmazestory.jpg" height="400" width="450">
    <p style="background-color:White;font-family:'Courier New'"><font size=4>For our first Scratch project, my group and I decided to make a fantasy story in which you are stuck in a maze and are given different options in order to find your way out. According to the decisions you make, you will either survive or end up in finding your way out of the maze. We incorporated many aspects of coding, such as changing backgrounds, having events and procedures, and more, to make the game more engaging for the player.</font></p>
